% WAVESURR3 Surrogate data for a two-dimensional time series via the wavelet transform

arguments
    X (:,:,:) {mustBeNumeric}
    options.wavelet = 'sym4'; % See https://au.mathworks.com/help/wavelet/ug/wavelet-analysis-for-3d-data.html

% 1. generate a Gaussian white noise time series to match the original data length
X_ = randn(size(X));

% 2. derive the wavelet transform of this noise to extract the phase Ï†(t,f)
[a_,d_] = dualtree3(X_);

% 3. combine this randomised phase and the WT modulus of the original signal to obtain a surrogate time-frequency distribution
[a, d] = dualtree3(X); % Leave the a's untouched
d = arrayfun(@(x) abs(d{x}).*exp(angle(d_{x})*1i), 1:length(d_), 'un', 0);

% 4. a nonstationary surrogate time series x^(t) is reconstructed by taking the real part of the inverse wavelet transform of Wx^(t,f)
X_ = idualtree3(a, d);
X_ = sigma.*X_./std(X_, 0, 'all', 'omitnan');

% 5. rescale the surrogate x^(t) to the distribution of the original time series by sorting the data (after a wavelet filtering in the frequency band of interest) according to the ranking of values of the wavelet-based surrogate11,
% ! Won't do this, since sorting data over multiple dimensions is not clear. If you like you can try:


X_ = X_ + mu;
X_(nanidxs) = NaN
